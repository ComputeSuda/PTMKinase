## Overview

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on protein contribute to variouse protein isoforms with
little evolutionary cost, regulating protein functions in cell signaling events and being involved 
in many diseases. The increasingly wealth of information on PTMs presents the challenge of 
understanding the dynamical properties of PTM sites, by which mechanism the allosteric regulation 
underlying PTMs would extremely enlarge the target space in drug design. Here, we integrate the 
sequence information, structural topology and in particular dynamics features to characterize the 
PTMs in the well known targetsâ€”kinase dataset. We demonstrate that machine learning can successfully
classify the PTM sites and active sites compared with other residues, especially with the dynamics 
features.
